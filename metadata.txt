qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Connects to ODK Central to post-process spatial survey data. Allows layer splitting based on a selected attribute
version=0.1
author=Felix Mutua
email=mutua@ags.co.ke

about=The plugin connects to ODK Central, retrieves form submissions, extracts spatial data (e.g., GPS coordinates, points, or geometries), and converts them into a valid GeoJSON FeatureCollection. The resulting GeoJSON can be used for mapping, analysis, or integration into GIS platforms. It helps streamline the process of importing spatial data from ODK into QGIS for further analysis and visualization. It also allows splitting of a layer based on unique values in a given attribute.  The Plugin requires requests package
