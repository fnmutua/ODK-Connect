version=0.1
author=Felix Mutua

about=The plugin connects to ODK Central, retrieves form submissions, extracts spatial data (e.g., GPS coordinates, points, or geometries), and converts them into a valid GeoJSON FeatureCollection. The resulting GeoJSON can be used for mapping, analysis, or integration into GIS platforms. It helps streamline the process of importing spatial data from ODK into QGIS for further analysis and visualization.
